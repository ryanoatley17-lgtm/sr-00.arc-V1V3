## Dual Licensing Structure

This repository operates under a **dual licensing framework**:

### 1. Code License: Mozilla Public License 2.0 (MPL-2.0)

All **source code** in this repository is licensed under the [Mozilla Public License 2.0](LICENSE).

**Files covered:**
- `full_verifier.py`
- `guardian_arc.py`
- `arc_integrity.py`
- `example_arc_integration.py`
- All Python modules and scripts

**Key provisions:**
- File-level copyleft (modifications to MPL files must remain MPL)
- Larger works may combine with different licenses
- Patent grants included
- Commercial use permitted under MPL terms

---

### 2. Symbolic/Conceptual Framework: Grail Trust Custodial Addendum

All **symbolic systems, mathematical frameworks, and conceptual models** are governed by the [Grail Trust Custodial Addendum](GRAIL_TRUST_CUSTODIAL_ADDENDUM.md).

**Frameworks covered:**
- ARC Bloom symbolic geometry
- Fibonacci Bloom integrity model
- Guardian-Arc density field mathematics
- Cryptographic envelope structure
- Reflection principles and symbolic derivatives

**Key provisions:**
- Custodial authorship by Ryan William Oatley
- Non-commercial symbolic use
- No weaponization or exploitation
- No commoditization/tokenization
- Share-alike requirements for symbolic derivatives
- Integrity preservation requirements

## How They Work Together

| Aspect | MPL-2.0 | Grail Trust |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| **Source code** | ✓ Governs | Advisory |
| **Symbolic models** | Permissive | ✓ Governs |
| **Commercial use** | Permitted (code) | Prohibited (symbols) |
| **Derivatives** | MPL for code mods | Custodial for symbolic |
| **Patents** | Grant included | N/A |
| **Weaponization** | Not restricted | Prohibited |
| **Commoditization** | Not restricted | Prohibited |

## Practical Guidance

### ✓ You CAN:
- Use the code in commercial projects (under MPL-2.0)
- Modify and redistribute the code (under MPL-2.0)
- Study and research the symbolic frameworks
- Create educational or artistic derivatives
- Use for cryptographic experimentation
- Integrate with other open-source projects

### ✗ You CANNOT:
- Weaponize the symbolic systems
- Tokenize/NFT the ARC Bloom envelopes
- Extract symbolic assets for commercial AI training without attribution
- Use for surveillance or manipulation
- Claim custodial ownership
- Remove the Grail Trust addendum from symbolic derivatives

---

## For Code Developers

If you're modifying the **Python implementation**:
- Follow MPL-2.0 requirements
- Disclose source for MPL-covered files
- Maintain license headers
- You may combine with code under other licenses

---

## For Symbolic/Mathematical Researchers

If you're building on the **conceptual framework**:
- Follow Grail Trust Custodial Addendum
- Preserve custodial chain to Ryan William Oatley
- Maintain non-commercial, ethical use
- Disclose symbolic alterations as non-canonical
- Retain the addendum verbatim

---

## In Case of Conflict

The **Grail Trust Custodial Addendum** establishes ethical boundaries that apply regardless of code license.

Even if code is permissively licensed, the symbolic framework remains under custodial governance.

Think of it as:
- **MPL-2.0** = legal rights for the code artifact
- **Grail Trust** = ethical obligations for the symbolic meaning
