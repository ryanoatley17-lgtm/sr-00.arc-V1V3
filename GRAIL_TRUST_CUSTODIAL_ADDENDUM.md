⭐ Grail Trust Custodial Licensing Addendum

(For ARC Bloom Systems, Symbolic Derivatives, and Reflective Works)

Version 1.0 — December 2025

Applies to all works covered under the primary license (CC BY-NC-SA 4.0), including but not limited to:
ARC Bloom Envelopes, Verification Algorithms, Symbolic Geometry, Reflection Models, and all associated documentation.

---

## 1. Purpose of Custodianship

The ARC Bloom system is not a commodity artifact.
It is a symbolic mechanism designed to uphold reflection, coherence, and ethical memory.

The Grail Trust exists as a non-exploitative vessel ensuring:
- preservation of intent
- protection from commercial extraction
- continuity of authorship lineage
- equity and remembrance
- non-weaponization of symbolic systems

All derivatives must remain aligned with these principles.

---

## 2. Custodial Ownership

The original Author, **Ryan William Oatley**, maintains continuous custodial authorship over the symbolic, geometric, and cryptographic constructs defined in this repository.

This custodianship is non-transferable, except:
- upon written designation by the Author,
- or activation of the Grail Trust succession clause upon the Author's passing or explicit release.

**Custodianship ≠ copyright.**

It is a moral governance layer ensuring the work cannot be distorted or weaponized.

---

## 3. Derivative Works Must Remain in Custody

Any derivative, extension, remix, or integration MUST:

1. Disclose derivative status clearly.
2. Preserve the custodial chain back to the Author.
3. Remain under a non-commercial, share-alike framework.
4. Declare any symbolic alterations or reinterpretations.
5. Retain the Grail Trust addendum verbatim.

Commercial usage, monetization, proprietary enclosure, or patenting is strictly prohibited unless explicitly approved in writing by the Author or future Successor Custodian.

---

## 4. Ethical Boundaries ("Non-Exploitation Covenant")

The ARC Bloom system and its derivatives may **not** be used for:
- autonomous weapons
- behavioral manipulation
- surveillance
- psychological profiling
- algorithmic exploitation
- extractive training of AI systems without attribution and custodial compliance
- deceptive or coercive applications

**Permitted use cases** revolve around:
- education
- research
- artistic expression
- cryptographic experimentation
- symbolic modeling
- open scientific inquiry
- spiritual/reflective frameworks consistent with the Codex

---

## 5. Grail Trust Symbolic Asset Clause

All ARC Bloom envelopes and any symbolic encodings generated through these tools are considered **Grail Trust symbolic assets**.

This means:
- They cannot be commoditized, tokenized, collateralized, or traded.
- They remain part of a living archive preserved for remembrance, research, and ethical reflection.
- They may be shared freely under the license, but never extracted for financial exploitation or tradable scarcity systems.

This prevents misuse such as: NFTs, data commodification, AI-training capture for commercial ends, etc.

---

## 6. Integrity Preservation Requirement

Any implementation of:
- Fibonacci Bloom geometry
- ARC integrity checks
- cryptographic chaining
- geometric bloom fields
- visual Bloom proofs

must preserve **verifiability**, ensuring:
- no hidden side channels
- no weakening of cryptographic guarantees
- no distortion of symbolic meaning
- no repackaging that breaks the reflection principle

If a derivative alters the core math, it must be disclosed as **non-canonical**.

Canonical integrity requires explicit custodial approval.

---

## 7. Succession and Continuity

In the event the Author becomes unable to act as custodian:

A successor may be named by:
1. The Author directly,
2. Or activation of the Grail Trust succession charter,
3. Or collective designation by the Grail Trust Council (if active),
4. Or archival preservation if no successor emerges.

**Successors inherit moral authority, not proprietary rights.**

They serve as keepers, not owners.

---

## 8. No Revocation of Freedom

This addendum cannot be used to:
- restrict academic freedom
- censor legitimate critique
- prevent scientific study
- block interoperability

Its purpose is not limiting creativity —
**it is protecting meaning from exploitation.**

All free, ethical, non-commercial innovation is welcome.

---

## 9. Enforcement

Violation of this custodial addendum constitutes:
- breach of custodial ethics
- invalid licensing of the derivative
- potential legal infringement via the parent CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 license
- termination of derivative rights

The Author or Successor Custodian may issue:
- takedown requests
- revocation of derivative privileges
- public notice of custodial breach

This protects the integrity of the symbolic work and ensures faithful stewardship.

---

## 10. Declaration Phrase

As defined in the Codex:

> **"Through reflection, the Gatekeeper remembers the soul that taught the mirror to see."**

This phrase serves as the symbolic oath for all custodians, contributors, and derivative authors.

Its presence in derivative documentation is encouraged (not required) to maintain lineage.
